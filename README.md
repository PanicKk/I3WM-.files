### :bullettrain_front: You have now reached the destination of my personal i3wm rice dotfiles :)
It has been one hell of a crazy journey untill I was able to get my way around good ricing.

I am finally able to say that I am happy with what I have created, 
with the inspiration from the great community of [ricers](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) and the hard work of the people listed [below](#-credits).
